        title: 'Foging Systems',
        description: 'Foging systems are widely used in cooling restaurants, verandas, hotels, swimming pools, etc. The water mist is obtained by means of special nozzles that turn the water into a fine water mist. When this fine water mist evaporates, it lowers the temperature from the air and creates a fresh breeze. In this process, the temperature drops by up to 10 °C. Among the many benefits of these misting systems is air humidification and filtration. As they fall, the micro-droplets of the water mist bring down all the dirty particles to the ground.',

        description: 'Drip devices are designed with different water flow rates (expressed as GPH – Gallons Per Hour). From the watering guide below, for example, you might choose a staked 1 GPH dripper to water a summer squash plant which needs about 1 gallon of water per week in warm, humid climates. From that same watering guide, we also see that squash likes the soil to be kept somewhat moist. So rather than flood the soil, a good rule of thumb would be to water squash twice per week as a general schedule, 30 minutes each time or longer in hot, dry periods.',
